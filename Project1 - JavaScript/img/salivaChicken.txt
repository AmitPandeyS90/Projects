Literally translated as “saliva chicken,” because you'll salivate when you even think about this dish.

Sometimes Chinese dishes have weird names that don’t describe what the dish is made of and may actually turn off some unfamiliar diners -- this is one of those dishes.

Boiled chicken is marinated in a chili and sesame oil sauce that features 10 spices and sauces making it a fiery yet mouth-watering dish.

This appetizer dish is served at all fine Sichuan restaurants.
